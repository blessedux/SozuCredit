# Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Redirect Not Working** - FIXED
- Changed from `router.replace("/dashboard")` to `window.location.href = "/dashboard"`
- This ensures a reliable, immediate redirect
- Applied to all redirect locations in the auth flow

### 2. **API Routes Returning HTML** - REQUIRES RESTART
- Fixed middleware to exclude API routes from authentication checks
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Restart your dev server for this to take effect

## üö® Action Required: Restart Dev Server

The middleware changes won't take effect until you restart the dev server:

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
pnpm dev
```

After restarting, the API routes should return JSON instead of HTML.

## What Should Happen After Restart

1. **Click fingerprint button**
2. **Login attempt** ‚Üí Gets "User not found" (expected for first time)
3. **Registration flow** ‚Üí Creates passkey and saves to database
4. **Redirect** ‚Üí Uses `window.location.href` to redirect to `/dashboard`
5. **Dashboard loads** ‚Üí Shows dashboard content

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Redirect fixed - now uses `window.location.href`
- ‚è≥ API routes fix - waiting for dev server restart
- ‚úÖ Error handling improved
- ‚úÖ Passkey saving to database

## Testing After Restart

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click fingerprint button
3. Should see:
   - `[Auth] Step 1: Attempting login...`
   - `[Auth] Login challenge failed (user may not exist), will try registration...`
   - `[Auth] Reg Step 1: Generating registration challenge...`
   - `[Auth] Reg Step 7: Redirecting to dashboard...`
   - **Page should redirect to `/dashboard`**

If you still see the HTML error after restarting, let me know and we'll debug further.
