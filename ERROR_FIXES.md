# Error Fixes Applied

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Error Handling in Login Flow

- Added better error handling for challenge generation failures
- Made "User not found" errors expected and handled gracefully
- Added try-catch around Supabase client creation

### 2. Better Error Messages

- Errors are now properly logged with context
- Different error types are identified (expected vs unexpected)

## Common Error Scenarios

### Error: "User not found" (Expected)

- **When**: First time user clicking the fingerprint button
- **Why**: User "user" doesn't exist in database yet
- **Solution**: This error is now caught and triggers registration flow automatically
- **Action**: None needed - registration will happen automatically

### Error: "No passkeys found" (Expected)

- **When**: User exists but hasn't created a passkey yet
- **Why**: User was created but passkey registration failed
- **Solution**: This error triggers registration flow
- **Action**: Registration will create the passkey

### Error: "Failed to generate authentication challenge"

- **When**: API route `/api/auth/login/challenge` fails
- **Why**: Could be database connection issue or API route error
- **Solution**: Check:
  1. Supabase environment variables are set correctly
  2. Database tables exist (run SQL scripts)
  3. API route is working (check server logs)

### Error: Supabase Client Creation Fails

- **When**: `createClient()` throws an error
- **Why**: Missing environment variables or invalid configuration
- **Solution**:
  1. Check `.env.local` has both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  2. Restart dev server after adding env vars
  3. This error is now caught and uses sessionStorage fallback

## Testing

1. **First Time User**:

   - Click fingerprint button
   - Should see: "Login failed, attempting registration..."
   - Should proceed to registration automatically
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard` after registration

2. **Existing User**:
   - Click fingerprint button
   - Should see: "Login successful"
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard` immediately

## Next Steps

If you're still seeing errors:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for error messages starting with `[Auth]`
2. **Check Network Tab**: See what API calls are failing
3. **Check Server Logs**: Look for errors in your terminal where `pnpm dev` is running
4. **Verify Database**: Make sure tables exist and user can be created

## Quick Debug Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables are set in `.env.local`
- [ ] Dev server restarted after adding env vars
- [ ] Database tables exist (check Supabase dashboard)
- [ ] Browser console shows `[Auth]` logs
- [ ] Network tab shows API calls (some may fail - that's OK)
